# Rsemantic

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/josephwilk/rsemantic.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/josephwilk/rsemantic)

A Ruby document vector search with flexible matrix transforms. Current supported transforms: 

* Latent semantic analysis
* Term frequency - inverse document frequency

Documentation: http://github.com/josephwilk/rsemantic/wikis/home

## Requirements:

* GSL - http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl

## INSTALL:

Note 'brew install GSL' installs 1.15 which is not supported yet by the gsl gem. So you have to switch your GSL version to 1.14.

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/josephwilk/rsemantic.git
cd rsemantic

brew tap homebrew/versions
brew install gsl114
